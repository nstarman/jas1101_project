# JAS 1101 Final Project

The study of intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) is important as they can enhance our understanding of the evolutionary connections between stellar black holes and super-massive black holes. This study aims to determine the statistical significance of IMBHs in the center of globular clusters (GCs) as a population and whether a black hole mass - velocity dispersion correlation of holds for IMBHs. This study utilizes a combination of fundamental data analysis methods from astronomy as well as statistics, notably Bayesian modeling, to determine constraints on black hole masses. The results indicate that the constraints derived are promising. The code for this study is available here. The full analysis pipeline is available as a console script upon code installation.
